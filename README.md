The two .py files in this directory are main.py and interface.py
main.py is the step response program intended to generate a step response in the NUCLEO circuit, read and printed from the adc reading
interface.py sends a signal to the nucleo to run the main.py program, when the program is on the nucleo
  it then compares the response of the nucleo on a GUI graph to the expected, simulated response
